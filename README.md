COLORWORLD 
v.1
Developed by Ampersand Paris

## Description
COLORWORLD was developed with the intention to give the user a unique vehicle to experience ‘color’ ‘gradient’ and ‘web colors’.
 
The gameplay is simple. The user is a transparent ‘blob’ who has been tasked to save the colors of our universe by absorbing the colors of the rainbow (Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, and Violet). The blob must do so before nightfall or all colors will be lost. 

## Usage
The player inputs a name where prompted and is placed in the middle of a color gradient landscape. The player navigates the color gradient landscape using the arrow keys on the keyboard. The player has two minutes to collect all seven colors in the landscape. If the user falls into a black hole, the user is placed back in the center of the board and loses the most recently picked up color and must pick up the color again. If all colors are collected before two minutes, and nightfall, the player wins. If not, the game is over. 

## Wireframe
When the user arrives to COLORWORLD, the landing page is in black and white. This page will be intuitively designed to contain a drop down that will explain gameplay and prompt the user to name their blob. 

Once the user submits the blob’s name, the user will be brough to the color gradient landscape. The user will traverse this landscape and pick up the seven colors of the rainbow (Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, and Violet). As the player picks up colors, the blob absorbs the colors. Meanwhile, darkness is falling across the gradient landscape marking the passage of time. If all seven colors are absorbed before nightfall, the user succeeds. If the user does not collect all seven colors before nightfall, the user looses the game. 

## USER STORIES Reach
The next level of this game is to include ‘black holes’ that the blob can fall into while navigating the landscape. When the player falls into a black hole, the player drops the most recently picked up color and is placed back into the central landscape location.
